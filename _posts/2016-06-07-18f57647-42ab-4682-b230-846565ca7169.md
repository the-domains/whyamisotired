It's All About Your L. I. F. E. S. T. Y. L. E.

L 

• Live for tomorrow by taking action today

What you do today is going to affect you for many days to come. Make what you do right now be in line with what you want to see yourself as in the future. If you want to be 50 years old and full of energy, watch somebody who already is. I guarantee you they are active and eat healthy. There's no other way. When we are kids, our bodies are growing and using a lot of energy. That's why we could eat so much food! However, even kids are not immune to a sedentary lifestyle and bad nutrition. Childhood obesity is on the rise, as is Diabetes and other lifestyle related conditions in children. The good news is, if you get on track now, whatever your age, you can start improving your life today. Little by little, if you keep with it, you will get healthier. Just like drinking a soda every day for a year will add to your caloric intake, drinking one less soda a day or switching to a healthier alternative will lessen your caloric intake. It's common sense, but only true if you use it! 

I 

• Invest in yourself

Would you pay me $600 if I could wave a magic wand and make you lose twenty pounds of fat and gain muscle right now? Join a gym and make it happen for yourself in six months. It will feel great! While you're at it, take the time or spend the money to find a plan that will really keep you on track. There are plenty of people with tons of good ideas and experience in every town in this country that you can work with to get healthy. Who doesn't know of at least one health nut? Type "Fitness Program" into your search engine and start reading. Don't jump at the first well advertised program, but skim around for awhile. I'll bet you will find that most people advocate a healthy diet and exercise as the most effective way to live longer and enjoy life. 

F 

• Follow the plan

Don't just go 50% and then complain about how it didn't work for you. Run your plan by someone you trust to make sure it's sensible, and go for it. Make the time, do the work, and give it at least a month of solid effort. If you fall off the wagon, get back on. By the way, it's normal to fall off the wagon. Getting back on is a little less common, but you can do it if you want to badly enough.... 

• Find some reasons

Motivation comes in many forms. Positive and negative, future and past, if it works for you, use it. If you like to watch TV uninterrupted, go to a gym with television sets in front of the cardio machines and zone out to the boob tube! Maybe your reason is totally vain - you like to look good. If that gets you to the gym, let yourself be vain! Once you start seeing results because you are following a nutrition and exercise plan, it will get really easy to motivate yourself to workout. You'll know that what you are doing is good for you, and you will actually feel good physically when you are there! 

E 

• Educate your 'self'

Your body is like a computer ready to intake information. If you fill it with high quality fuel and give it work to do each day, it will step up to the challenge. Try this: Eat really healthy for a week. That means no crappy fast food, no candy bars, not much sugar, and lots of fruits and vegetables. In fact, buy so much of your favorite healthy food that you have it around every time you get hungry. Don't worry about calories, eat as much as you want as long as it's healthy. After a week, spend a day eating whatever you want - candy, ice cream, doughnuts, anything! Your body will tell you to stop eating crap on that last day earlier than you are used to. You see, your body is going to adapt to the situation you put it in. If you are eating healthy, it will turn into a high performance roadster. If you are eating terribly, it will turn into a big old bus with a weak engine. 

S 

• Succeed every day

Make exercise a habit and do a little of it every day. If it's not an option to miss exercise everyday, you don't ever have to be faced with the question "should I exercise today or tomorrow?" Make it easy to succeed. If I make it to the gym and go through my workout, I feel like I've succeeded. Whether I lift more or run faster isn't that big of a deal to me. If I drink a glass of water instead of a soda or beer, I congratulate myself. It's one more step in the right direction. If I fall off the wagon and re-dedicate myself, that's a job well done. Nobody is perfect, and nobody follows any plan to a T one hundred percent of the time. Go for perfection if that's what motivates you, but be satisfied with steps in the right direction. 

T 

• Try the alternative

Try eating all the bad food you have been craving once a week and see how you feel. Better yet, when you are sitting at the restaurant eating that double bacon cheeseburger, check out the other folks in the room. Can you guess which ones have been using "the alternative" as a lifestyle consistently? Sure you can. 

Y 

• Yellow means slow down, not stop

If you feel tired or a little bit low on energy, take it easy. If you feel dizzy, that's a red light! Stop and drink water. Get help if the feeling persists. If you get sick or injured, let your body heal and then slowly get back in the game. Of course, you should always be safe when it comes to exercise and nutrition. There's no point in overdoing it once and having long term consequences from it, but stopping because it's hard to keep going isn't going to work. By asking a little more from yourself, your body adapts to the new expectations. If you ask the right way by using proper exercise and nutrition, your body will answer the right way. 

• Yearn for more

When you are feeling satisfied, it's time to challenge yourself again. If you have reached the point where your weight is where you like it and you are as healthy as you could ever imagine, imagine more! Find a way to inspire somebody else on. Try a sport or activity you wouldn't have dreamed about doing before. Use the techniques you used to get in shape to improve another part of your life.

L 

• Leverage yourself by considering the two different roads you can take

Put a line down the middle of a piece of paper and try this: On one side, write down where you'll be if you find a plan and get in shape. On the other side, write down the same for your current lifestyle. Ask yourself these questions: How much energy will I have? How will it affect my productivity at work, with my family, with my friends? How will I feel about myself? Who will be attracted to me and who will I be attracted to? What kind of medical expenses may I have? 

• Learn from failure (your own and the failures of others)

Your body learns from failure in the weight room. That's how it gets stronger. When you give it a job to do and it can't do it, as long as the job wasn't way too hard, it will strengthen its muscles in order to do better next time. When you give in and eat a food you know you shouldn't have, ask yourself what feeling you were satisfying and find an alternative. If it was hunger, get yourself some healthy alternatives (a protein bar is healthier than a candy bar). If it was boredom, make a list of all the things you could do besides eat next time you're bored. If it was sadness, think of some healthier ways to cheer yourself up. If it was loneliness, track down a long lost friend. And when you see others repeating mistakes that make their lives tougher, resolve to not make those same mistakes yourself. 

E 

• Expect road blocks

They will come, and when they do, you'll be ready for them! When I first started a 12 week exercise and nutrition program, it only took me about ten days to come down with a cold. I missed another 10 days of exercise. Then I got back on the horse. I'll probably get sick again in my life, but I know it won't throw me for a loop. For one thing, I'm healthier now, so when I do come down with a bug, I can still maintain my workouts and diet, just at a lower intensity. If I do get really sick and miss a lot of time, I know how to motivate myself and set healthy living as a priority. It doesn't mean life will be perfect, but it won't get in the way of staying in shape. That's why it's called a lifestyle, and 

once it's a lifestyle, it's tough to change!
